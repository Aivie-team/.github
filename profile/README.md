## 🚀 About Us

**Aivie** (pronounced "Eye-vee") is an AI-powered Chrome extension that improves real-time communication during online interviews. We combine **AI-driven coaching**, **live translation**, and **feedback analytics** to help talented professionals — especially non-native speakers — overcome communication barriers, anxiety, and cultural challenges during interviews.
